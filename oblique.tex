\section{Oblique Slice Extraction}
\markboth{Oblique Slice Extraction}{}
\label{sec:oblique}
We are given as input cuboid volume and 3 points inside it, designating a desired plane.
The output should be a rectangular area, in which the desired slice is bounded.
We bring the algorithm here, as we searched for suitable ready-made algorithm or code, but eventually we had to devise it ourselves.
The algorithm proceeds as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Find intersections of the plane with the data box edges.
	\item For these points, find a rectangle bounding-box.
	\item Find the affine transformation $T(x) = Ax + t $ from $\textrm{R} ^2$ to $\textrm{R}^3$.

	~~For each axes-pair:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Calculate the corners targets.
		\item Use them to calculate the transformation and the target dimensions.
	\end{enumerate}
	~~Take the axes-pair that yields the rectangle with minimum area.
	
	\item Use the transformation and do trilinear interpolation for every value in the 2D target image.
\end{enumerate}
