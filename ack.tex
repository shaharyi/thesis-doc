I would like to express my special appreciation and thanks to my supervisor, Professor Daniel Cohen-Or, who directed me in his gentle way in acuiring the good grounds for the field of Computer Graphics. He planted hints along the way that turned out very useful in the research process.
\\
I would also like to thank Mr. Eyal Zadicario, doctorant at TAU, for his assistance and inspirational talks during the entire research period.
\\
Furthermore I'd like to thank Professor Tau Ju of MIT, who helped compile, write and submit the original published article, under the same name as this thesis.
\\
Last but not least, I'd like to express my deepest gratitude to my beloved wife, Chen, for her love, support and patience.
